    <h1>No Logs Policy</h1>

    <p>Last updated: Saturday, February 15th, 2025<br><br>
        This No Logs Policy ("Policy") outlines Backyard Bandwidthâ€™s strict commitment to
        <b>not collecting, storing, or retaining logs</b> of any user activity across our VPN, VPS, and S3 storage services.
        By using our services, you acknowledge and accept that we do <b>not store logs</b> and that we <b>cannot provide data that does not exist</b>
        in response to law enforcement requests.
    </p>

    <h2>1. No Logging Commitment</h2>
    <p>Backyard Bandwidth does not store logs in any form, at any time, and for any purpose. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We <b>do not</b> store or retain VPN traffic logs.</li>
        <li>We <b>do not</b> log or track which websites users visit.</li>
        <li>We <b>do not</b> log VPN session durations or timestamps.</li>
        <li>We <b>do not</b> retain IP addresses for longer than <b>24 hours</b>.</li>
        <li>We <b>do not</b> log VPS server activity.</li>
        <li>We <b>do not</b> maintain logs of S3 storage access or file activity.</li>
        <li>All log information is <b>immediately sent to /dev/null</b> upon generation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Data Shredding and Immediate Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        Backyard Bandwidth operates a <b>zero-retention</b> infrastructure for all log-related data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>All temporary connection logs are automatically deleted within <b>24 hours</b>.</li>
        <li>Once a VPS service is terminated, all associated data is <b>forensically shredded and permanently deleted</b>.</li>
        <li>VPN session data is <b>never written to disk</b> and is permanently discarded after session termination.</li>
        <li>There are <b>no log files</b> stored on VPN, VPS, or S3 storage servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Law Enforcement and Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>
        Backyard Bandwidth operates under <b>United States jurisdiction</b> and complies with all applicable laws.
        However, our strict <b>No Logs Policy</b> means that we <b>cannot provide</b> any of the following data upon request from law enforcement, government agencies, or third parties:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>VPN usage logs</li>
        <li>Browsing history</li>
        <li>VPN session timestamps</li>
        <li>Original or assigned IP addresses beyond the last 24 hours</li>
        <li>VPS activity logs</li>
        <li>S3 storage activity logs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We will cooperate with legally binding requests <b>only to the extent we are technically and physically capable</b>.
        If we receive a subpoena, warrant, or other legal request for user data, our response will be limited to confirming that
        <b>we do not store logs and, therefore, have no information to provide</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Limited Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        The only information Backyard Bandwidth temporarily retains is:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Half of the user's email address for account verification and customer support purposes.</li>
        <li>The user's IP address for up to <b>24 hours</b> to prevent abuse and ensure security.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        After this <b>24-hour period</b>, all stored IP address data is <b>automatically and permanently deleted</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. No Backups or Shadow Logging</h2>
    <p>
        Backyard Bandwidth does <b>not</b> maintain backups of deleted logs, and we do <b>not</b> engage in shadow logging.
        Our <b>entire infrastructure is designed</b> to prevent the storage of log data. Any attempt to retrieve user data beyond
        what is outlined in this policy is <b>technically impossible</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>6. No Third-Party Tracking</h2>
    <p>
        We do <b>not</b> use third-party tracking, analytics, or logging services. Backyard Bandwidth does not partner with any
        <b>data brokers</b>, <b>advertising agencies</b>, or <b>analytics platforms</b> that collect, share, or store user data.
    </p>

        By accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this No Logs Policy.
        If you do not agree with these terms, you must discontinue use of the Service immediately.
