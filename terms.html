        This section shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with United States federal law. Any disputes

    <p>
        Backyard Bandwidth reserves the sole and absolute right to refuse service to any individual, entity, or
        jurisdiction at its discretion,
        without obligation to provide justification. This includes, but is not limited to, cases where a customer is
        suspected of violating our policies,
        engaging in prohibited activities, or posing a financial or reputational risk to our business.
    </p>
    <p>
        Refunds are not guaranteed and are assessed on a case-by-case basis at the sole discretion of Backyard
        Bandwidth.
        We maintain the exclusive right to deny any refund request for any reason, including, but not limited to:

    <ul>
        <li>Failure to comply with our Terms of Service, Fair Use Policy, or any applicable agreements.</li>
        <li>Service terminations due to non-payment, policy violations, or legal/regulatory concerns.</li>
        <li>Requests based on personal dissatisfaction unrelated to service functionality or performance.</li>
        <li>Situations where a customer has already used a substantial portion of the service period or resources.</li>
        <li>Failure to cancel a service before the next billing cycle.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        No Chargebacks or Disputes: By using our services, you agree not to initiate chargebacks, payment disputes, or
        unauthorized reversals
        through your financial institution. Any such actions may result in immediate account termination and legal
        enforcement to recover costs incurred.
    </p>
    <p>
        Backyard Bandwidth reserves the right to modify this policy at any time, with changes taking effect immediately
        upon posting.
        By continuing to use our services, you acknowledge and agree to these terms and waive any claims regarding
        denied refunds or service refusals.
    </p>


    <h2>Billing and Account Termination Policy</h2>
    <p>
        Customers are required to ensure timely and full payment for all services provided by Backyard Bandwidth.
        Any invoices that remain unpaid for more than <strong>7 days</strong> past the due date will be considered
        delinquent.
        Backyard Bandwidth reserves the right to immediately terminate services for any account that remains past
        due beyond this period, at its sole discretion.
    </p>

    <h3>Termination Consequences</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Immediate Termination:</strong> If an account is delinquent by more than 7 days, Backyard
            Bandwidth may permanently terminate the account and all associated services without further notice.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Permanent Data Deletion:</strong> Once an account is terminated, all associated data, including VPS
            instances, storage, backups, and any related services, will be permanently deleted without the possibility
            of recovery.
        </li>
        <li><strong>No Liability for Data Loss:</strong> Backyard Bandwidth is not liable for any data loss
            resulting from service termination due to non-payment.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Unpaid Balances & Collections:</strong> Any outstanding balances may be referred to third-party
            collection agencies or legal proceedings, and the customer agrees to be responsible for any associated
            collection fees, legal costs, or other enforcement expenses.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Customer Responsibility</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It is the customer's responsibility to maintain accurate billing information and ensure that their
            selected payment method remains valid.
        </li>
        <li>By using Backyard Bandwidth, you authorize us to charge your selected payment method for recurring
            services, applicable taxes, and any outstanding balances.
        </li>
        <li>Failed payments may result in additional processing fees or service disruptions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>No Refund Policy</h3>
    <p>
        Unless explicitly stated in a separate agreement, all payments are final and non-refundable.
        Termination of services due to non-payment or policy violations does not entitle the customer to a refund or
        credit.
    </p>

    <h3>Policy Updates & Acceptance</h3>
    <p>
        Backyard Bandwidth reserves the right to modify this policy at any time.
        Continued use of the services after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
        Customers are responsible for reviewing billing policies periodically.
    </p>

    <p>
        By using our services, you acknowledge and agree to this Billing and Account Termination Policy
        and accept any legal and financial obligations associated with non-payment.
    </p>

    <h3>Collection Efforts</h3>
    <p>
        We will make reasonable attempts to collect overdue payments, including sending reminders and notifications.
        Backyard Bandwidth reserves the right to send customers to collections if payment is not received
        within a reasonable timeframe. By using our services, you agree that unpaid balances may be referred to a
        third-party
        collection agency or legal action may be pursued to recover the owed amount. Any additional costs incurred in
        the
        collection process, including but not limited to attorney fees, court fees, and collection agency charges,
        will be the responsibility of the customer.
    </p>

    <p>
        To avoid service disruption, customers are encouraged to maintain up-to-date billing information and ensure
        timely payment of invoices.
    </p>

    <p>
        By continuing to use our services, you acknowledge and agree to this Billing and Account Termination Policy,
        and you accept any legal and financial obligations arising from non-payment.
    </p>

    <h2>Price Modeling and Changes</h2>
    <p>
        Backyard Bandwidth reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, adjust, or update the pricing of its
        services at any time to reflect changes in operational costs, market conditions, inflation, or other business
        needs. Price changes may include increases or decreases and shall apply to all new and existing customers unless
        otherwise specified.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the event of a price increase, Backyard Bandwidth will provide advance notice to affected customers via
        email, with the notice period determined at our discretion. The notice will specify the revised pricing, the
        effective date, and any applicable changes to billing cycles or subscription renewals. Failure to receive such
        notice due to outdated or incorrect contact information provided by the customer does not exempt the customer
        from the new pricing once effective.
    </p>
    <p>
        By continuing to use our services after the effective date of a price change, you expressly acknowledge, accept,
        and agree to the new pricing. If you do not agree with the updated pricing, you must cancel your service before
        the change takes effect. Continued use of the services beyond the effective date constitutes binding acceptance
        of the new pricing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Backyard Bandwidth is under no obligation to issue refunds, credits, or price adjustments for any pricing
        changes, unless explicitly required by law or outlined in a written agreement. By using our services, you agree
        that price modifications are a necessary component of maintaining sustainable business operations and that
        Backyard Bandwidth shall not be held liable for any damages, losses, or claims resulting from such changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        This provision constitutes a legally binding agreement between Backyard Bandwidth and its customers. Any
        disputes arising from price changes shall be governed by the laws of the United States and adjudicated in a
        court of competent jurisdiction within the state of operation of Backyard Bandwidth.
    </p>

    <h2>Fair Use Agreement</h2>
    <p>
        By using Backyard Bandwidth services, you agree to comply with all applicable United States laws and
        regulations, as well as this Fair Use Agreement.

        in immediate suspension or termination of access without refund or prior notice.

            databases, or accounts.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Backyard Bandwidth reserves the right to investigate suspected violations of this Fair Use Agreement.
        However, we will only monitor and enforce these terms to the extent that we are technically and legally capable,
        in accordance with our <a href="logging-policy.html">Logging Policy</a>. We do not engage in active surveillance
        of customer activities beyond the minimal necessary logging outlined in that policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a violation is detected within our technical capabilities, we may take appropriate legal action, report
        violations to law enforcement, and immediately terminate services at our sole discretion.
        Customers acknowledge that violating this agreement may result in termination of access without refund,
        and that Backyard Bandwidth shall not be held liable for any damages, losses, or claims resulting from
        enforcement of these terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Fair Use Agreement is a legally binding contract and is governed by the laws of the United States.
        Any disputes arising under this agreement shall be resolved in a court of competent jurisdiction in our state of
        operation.
    </p>

    <h2>Cooperation with Law Enforcement</h2>
    <p>
        Backyard Bandwidth respects user privacy and operates under a strict no-logging policy. However, we will comply
        with legally binding requests from law enforcement only when required by applicable law and within the technical
        and physical limitations of our infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Backyard Bandwidth does not voluntarily share, sell, or disclose user data to any third party, including law
        enforcement, unless compelled by a valid and properly issued legal request, such as a subpoena, court order, or
        other legally enforceable demand.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to our minimal data retention practices, the only information potentially available in response to such

            associated with an account (if available).
        </li>

    <p>
        We do not collect, log, or store any of the following:

        <li>VPN session durations, timestamps, or connection metadata.</li>
        <li>User-assigned or original IP addresses beyond the temporary 24-hour retention window.</li>
        <li>Any content, files, messages, or data transmitted through our services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If a legally binding request is made, Backyard Bandwidth will:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Evaluate the request for legal validity and compliance with U.S. law.</li>
        <li>Respond only to the extent required by law and within our technical capabilities.</li>
        <li>Notify the affected user, unless prohibited by law.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Backyard Bandwidth reserves the right to challenge or reject any legal request that we deem unlawful, overly
        broad, or in violation of our users’ rights.

        Policy</a>.
