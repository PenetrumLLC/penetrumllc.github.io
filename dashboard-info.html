  <h1>User Dashboard Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Last updated: Monday, August 4th, 2025<br><br>
    This policy explains how Backyard Bandwidth protects your privacy within the user dashboard and related account systems. We maintain a strict privacy-first architecture with minimal data retention and no behavioral analytics.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Account Identification</h2>
  <p>
    When a user registers, their email is associated with their Stripe billing account. However, we <b>do not store the full email address</b> on our platform. Instead:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A 15-character hash of the email is generated and stored alongside the username.</li>
    <li>This hash is used strictly for internal admin tools if manual lookup is required.</li>
    <li>Without the internal tools, it is <b>not possible to determine the user’s original email</b>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All user data is carefully compartmentalized and stored separately to ensure that, in the event of a breach or leak, <b>personally identifiable information (PII) cannot be correlated with usernames</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a manual lookup is required for operational or security reasons, we will first leave a visible message in the user’s upload directory notifying them of the pending lookup request. This message is <b>automatically generated by the backend</b> and <b>cannot be bypassed or suppressed by administrators</b>. It ensures full transparency and user awareness before any access occurs.
  </p>

  <h2>2. File Upload and Storage</h2>
  <p>
    Files are uploaded anonymously by vetted administrators using only the username. We do not track, tag, or store:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Uploader identity</li>
    <li>Upload timestamp</li>
    <li>IP addresses associated with the upload</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The only stored metadata is the <b>s3 file path</b>, which is necessary to display files back to the user. All uploads are encrypted and stored securely on an <b>encrypted S3-backed storage system</b>.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Download Activity and Logging</h2>
  <p>
    Backyard Bandwidth does <b>not log download activity</b>. Specifically:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>No IP addresses are logged during download.</li>
    <li>There is no record of how many times a file is downloaded.</li>
    <li>No file-specific user identifiers are associated with downloads.</li>
    <li>A basic 30-second cooldown is enforced purely to prevent backend abuse.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Downloads are served privately and directly to the session in use, with no tracking or fingerprinting.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Account Data and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    User accounts consist only of the following data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Username</li>
    <li>Unique account ID</li>
    <li>15-character email hash</li>
    <li>Stripe customer ID</li>
    <li>Encrypted, salted, and peppered password</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If a user wishes to remove their account, they may contact us directly. Upon request, we will:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Search for the account by username</li>
    <li>Permanently delete all associated account data and files</li>
    <li>Confirm deletion once complete</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We retain <b>no backup or archival copies</b> of deleted user data.</p>

  <h2>5. Admin Access & Vetting</h2>
  <p>
    All administrators undergo strict vetting before receiving access to internal tools. Administrative access is role-based and strictly limited to operational needs. Admins cannot see full email addresses or perform lookups without explicit need and elevated permission.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any action involving manual user lookup or elevated access <b>requires unanimous approval from all currently available administrators</b>. This approval process is enforced at the backend level and <b>cannot be bypassed, overridden, or performed individually</b>. Until full approval is granted, the requested action will not execute.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Session Privacy and Security</h2>
  <p>
    We do not log any of the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Login IP addresses</li>
    <li>Session durations</li>
    <li>Pages visited</li>
    <li>Mouse movements, clicks, or screen activity</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Session data is stored only in the client browser and exists solely to authenticate you to our backend. We do not persist session logs or cross-reference logins.
  </p>
  <p>
    Standard user sessions automatically expire after <strong>11 hours and 55 minutes (max_age: 42900 seconds)</strong>. Administrator sessions expire after <strong>50 minutes (admin_max_age: 3000 seconds)</strong>. Once expired, users must reauthenticate.
  </p>

  <h2>7. No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    We do not use any of the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Third-party analytics tools (Google Analytics, Plausible, etc.)</li>
    <li>Fingerprinting techniques</li>
    <li>Tracking cookies</li>
    <li>Browser or device profiling</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The user dashboard is fully self-contained and telemetry-free.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Data Sovereignty and Encryption</h2>
  <p>
    All user data is stored encrypted at rest and transmitted securely in transit. We enforce strict encryption policies on all endpoints, including internal services, and do not allow unencrypted access under any circumstances.
  </p>
  <p>
    While our primary systems operate within the United States, <b>data may be temporarily transferred to the user’s region at the time of request</b> in order to serve files or account data with minimal latency. This transfer is transient and does not result in persistent replication across jurisdictions.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also adhere to strict policies around <b>personally identifiable information (PII) separation</b>, ensuring that no identifiable data is stored alongside usernames or file metadata. Even in the event of a compromise, PII cannot be correlated to account activity.
  </p>


  <h2>9. Purchase Privacy and Payment Anonymity</h2>
  <p>
    Purchases using cash or crypto are tied only to the automatically generated username created at the time of registration. Each username is generated with approximately <b>81.52 bits of entropy</b>, meaning that even at one million guesses per second, it would take an estimated <b>~98 billion years</b> to brute-force the username.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a user chooses to pay via Stripe, the Stripe customer ID is stored with the account. While we never store full email addresses or PII, a sufficiently privileged actor with access to Stripe’s backend <b>could technically identify a user</b> through their payment metadata.
  </p>
  <p>
    All financial data—whether Stripe-based or crypto-based—is segregated from account metadata and file storage systems to preserve <b>maximum compartmentalization and privacy protection</b>.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
  <p>
    The user dashboard does <b>not use tracking cookies</b> or third-party scripts. We store only minimal session data in your browser’s local storage or session storage to maintain login state.
  </p>
  <p>
    The session token is <b>transmitted to the backend during each request</b> to verify that the user is authenticated. This token is <b>not stored on the backend</b>—it is used only during the request and immediately discarded.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the token expires or the user logs out, it becomes invalid and cannot be reused. The session data in the browser is automatically deleted when the session ends.
  </p>


  <h2>11. User Rights and Privacy Requests</h2>
  <p>
    Users may request information about the data associated with their account or ask questions related to our privacy practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are unable to modify or correct account details because we do not store any personally identifiable information beyond what is explicitly described in this policy. User data is intentionally minimal and immutable by design to protect user privacy.
  </p>
  <p>
    All inquiries can be made through our secure contact channels listed on the website. We respond to all legitimate privacy-related questions within a reasonable timeframe.
  </p>


    <h2>12. Breach Notification Policy</h2>
  <p>
    In the event of a confirmed data breach that impacts user privacy, we will promptly notify affected users and publish a detailed incident report. While our systems are designed to prevent correlation of user identity to data, we treat all security events seriously and transparently.
  </p>

    <h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may revise this dashboard privacy policy at any time. Updates will be posted on this page and become effective immediately upon publication.
