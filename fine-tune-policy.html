  <h1>Anova Fine-Tuning Policy</h1>

  <p>Last updated: Thursday, August 28th, 2025<br><br>
    This policy explains the rules and expectations for community participants who help fine-tune the Anova Large Language Model (LLM) in exchange for $BB payouts.
  </p>

<h2>1. Submission Review</h2>
<p>
  All submissions are subject to a formal review process for accuracy, quality, and compliance with this Fine-Tuning Policy. Reviews are conducted by our internal team and may include both automated checks and manual evaluation. The standard review period is up to <strong>2 weeks</strong> from the date of submission; however, this timeframe is provided as an estimate only and does not create a binding obligation.
</p>
<p>
  By participating in the fine-tuning program, you expressly acknowledge and agree that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The review process may be delayed, suspended, or extended at our sole discretion, including (but not limited to) delays caused by submission volume, technical issues, or the complexity of the material.</li>
  <li>We reserve the right to <strong>modify, shorten, or extend</strong> the review timeframe at any time <strong>without prior notice</strong> to participants.</li>
  <li>No payout, credit, or other form of compensation is owed to the participant solely on the basis of a submission being under review.</li>
  <li>Acceptance or denial of a submission is final and not subject to appeal or dispute once the review process is complete.</li>
  <li>We are under no legal obligation to provide justification or reasoning for denial, although such reasoning may be provided at our discretion.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The review process is an integral part of maintaining the integrity of the Anova fine-tuning program. Submissions are evaluated objectively, and we retain the exclusive right to determine whether a submission meets the quality and compliance standards required for payout eligibility.
</p>



<h2>2. Minimum Requirements</h2>
<p>
  To ensure the fine-tuning process of Anova remains high-quality, fair, and beneficial for all participants, all submissions must meet the following minimum requirements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Length Requirement:</strong> Any question or answer under <strong>250 characters in length</strong> is automatically denied without review.</li>

  <li><strong>Effort and Clarity:</strong> Submissions must demonstrate genuine effort and provide clear, structured responses. Content that is rushed, vague, incoherent, or incomplete will not be accepted.</li>

  <li><strong>Readability:</strong> Answers should be written in a way that is understandable to non-technical readers whenever possible. Overly complex, overly technical, or jargon-heavy answers that do not add value may be denied.</li>

  <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Submissions must directly address the specific question or prompt provided. Off-topic answers, generic content, or material unrelated to the question will be denied.</li>

  <li><strong>Accuracy and Reliability:</strong> All submissions must be factually correct and up to date. Outdated, misleading, or incorrect information will result in denial.</li>

  <li><strong>Code Quality:</strong> Any code provided must be directly relevant, functional, and executable. Code that does not run, contains obvious errors, or fails to address the problem will be denied.</li>

  <li><strong>Fraud and Misuse:</strong> Submissions that are fraudulent, spam-like, plagiarized, or intended to take advantage of the payout system will be denied. Claims of fact or copied material must include proper citations where appropriate.</li>

  <li><strong>Professionalism:</strong> Answers must maintain a professional and respectful tone. Submissions that include offensive, harmful, or otherwise inappropriate content will be denied.</li>

  <li><strong>Originality:</strong> Submissions must be original and provide value beyond simple rephrasing or repetition of existing content. Duplicate or low-effort submissions may be denied.</li>

  <li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> We reserve the right to deny any submission that, in our judgment, fails to meet the quality, accuracy, or integrity standards of this program—even if the specific issue is not explicitly listed above.</li>
</ul>


<h2>3. Grounds for Refusal</h2>
<p>
  We reserve the right to refuse payout to any participant at our sole discretion. Submissions may be denied if they fail to meet the required standards of quality, accuracy, and integrity. Grounds for refusal include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Repeated Low-Quality Submissions:</strong> Providing answers that are inaccurate, incomplete, vague, or otherwise lacking in quality on a consistent basis.</li>

  <li><strong>Spam and Abuse:</strong> Attempting to “game the system” with meaningless, irrelevant, or mass-generated content intended to earn payouts without contributing value.</li>

  <li><strong>Irrelevant or Unacceptable Content:</strong> Submissions that do not directly address the question, are off-topic, contain inappropriate material, or fail to meet the intent of the prompt.</li>

  <li><strong>Plagiarism and Misrepresentation:</strong> Copying existing content without proper citation, submitting third-party work as one’s own, or fabricating sources or references.</li>

  <li><strong>Fraudulent Behavior:</strong> Any attempt to manipulate results, falsify information, or exploit the payout process for unfair gain.</li>

  <li><strong>Outdated or Incorrect Information:</strong> Providing information that is no longer accurate, current, or relevant to the subject matter.</li>

  <li><strong>Non-Functional Code:</strong> Submitting code that does not compile, execute, or otherwise fails to solve the described problem.</li>

  <li><strong>Offensive or Harmful Submissions:</strong> Content that is abusive, discriminatory, or violates community standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Any behavior that undermines the fairness, integrity, or educational purpose of the fine-tuning process may result in denial of payouts and, in severe cases, permanent exclusion from participation.
</p>


<h2>4. Anonymity and Data Storage</h2>
<p>
  The fine-tuning platform is designed to operate as a fully <strong>anonymized system</strong>. We do not collect, track, or store any personally identifiable information (PII) from participants. The <strong>only data stored</strong> in relation to a submission includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>question</strong> being answered.</li>
  <li>The <strong>answer</strong> text provided by the participant.</li>
  <li>Any <strong>code</strong> that is submitted as part of the response.</li>
  <li>The participant’s <strong>wallet address</strong>, strictly for payout purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  To improve user experience, the provided wallet address may be stored in the participant’s <strong>local browser storage</strong> for a maximum of <strong>12 hours</strong>. This temporary storage exists solely on the user’s device and is not transmitted to, or retained by, our servers. Once expired, the wallet address is automatically removed and must be re-entered by the user.
</p>
<p>
  No names, email addresses, IP logs, account registrations, or other identifying details are collected. As a result, we have <strong>no ability to determine the real-world identity</strong> of the person behind any given submission. All evaluation, acceptance, and payout decisions are made solely on the content submitted and the wallet address provided for payment.
</p>
<p>
  Because of this design, it is the participant’s sole responsibility to ensure their wallet address is valid and correct. If payouts are made to an invalid, incorrect, or inaccessible wallet, we cannot recover those funds or reissue them elsewhere.
</p>



<h2>5. Payouts</h2>
<p>
  Payouts are calculated based on the following factors:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The <strong>current market price of $BB</strong> (Backyard Bandwidth, Solana-based token, contract address:
    <code>E7MYzWD8GtLYNsgRyECSts2p1s2mu5JLb6wR9CiCBAGS</code>):
    <span id="bbPrice">Loading...</span> USD
  </li>
  <li><strong>Question complexity</strong> (scope, required depth, difficulty, and originality).</li>
  <li><strong>Answer quality</strong> (technical accuracy and completeness).</li>
  <li><strong>Functional correctness</strong> (whether the solution works as intended during our internal review).</li>
  <li><strong>Clarity &amp; readability</strong> (grammar, structure, comments, and overall ease of understanding).</li>
  <li><strong>Coverage</strong> (does the answer address <em>all</em> parts of the prompt and any sub-requirements?).</li>
  <li><strong>Security &amp; robustness</strong> (safe handling of inputs, error handling, and reasonable performance where relevant).</li>
  <li><strong>Originality</strong> (no plagiarism; cite external sources or licenses when applicable).</li>
  <li><strong>Policy compliance</strong> (adheres to program rules and content guidelines).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bonuses &amp; deductions.</strong> We may apply discretionary bonuses for exemplary solutions (e.g., superb documentation, thoughtful edge-case handling, or performance improvements) and deductions for issues (e.g., inaccuracies, incomplete coverage, unclear writing, runtime errors, missing required artifacts, or policy violations).</p>

<p><strong>Who handles validation.</strong> We perform all validation and execution on our side. You are not required to perform or provide automated testing.</p>

<p><strong>How conversion works.</strong> Payout decisions are made in USD terms for clarity. The <em>on-chain amount of $BB</em> is calculated from the real-time USD price of $BB at the moment we send the transaction. Network fees are not deducted from your payout amount but are paid separately as part of the transfer process.</p>

<p><strong>Transparency.</strong> To improve trust in the process, we may publicly display acceptance/denial decisions with the submitted wallet address, decision reason, and decision date. Do not include any personal information in your submission.</p>

<p><strong>Finality.</strong> We are not responsible for payouts sent to invalid or incorrectly provided wallet addresses. If you provide an incorrect wallet, we cannot reverse or reissue the payout. All on-chain transfers are final.</p>


  <h2>6. Compliance with Other Policies</h2>
  <p>
    All participants in the fine-tuning program are required to abide by all other Backyard Bandwidth policies located at
    <a href="policy-list.html" class="underline text-bDarkBlue">policy-list.html</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may revise this Fine-Tuning Policy at any time. Updates will be posted on this page and become effective immediately upon publication.
