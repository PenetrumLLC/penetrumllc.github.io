    <h1>Fair Use Policy</h1>

    <p>Last Updated: Sunday, April 20th, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Fair Use Policy ("Policy") sets forth the acceptable use guidelines for Backyard Bandwidth's VPN, VPS,
        Splunk ingestion, indexing, storage services, and other related services ("Service"). While we do not impose
        arbitrary limits on bandwidth, speed, or usage, we maintain this policy to ensure fair and reasonable access for
        all users. By using our Service, you agree to comply with this Policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Unlimited Use Under Fair Use</h2>
    <p>Backyard Bandwidth provides VPN services without data caps or speed restrictions. However, this offering is
        contingent upon fair and reasonable use. Excessive or abnormal usage that negatively impacts network
        performance, degrades service quality for other users, or places an undue burden on our infrastructure may
        result in action under this Policy.</p>

    <p>Backyard Bandwidth does <strong>not log, track, or monitor user activity</strong> on our VPN services. Users are
        not subject to logging or tracking under our <a href="http://backyardbandwidth.com/policy.html">Privacy
            Policy</a>. We do not retain records of browsing history, connection times, metadata, IP addresses, or other
        identifying information related to VPN use.</p>

    <h2>3. VPS Privacy and Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Backyard Bandwidth does not log, monitor, or track user activity on our VPS services. We do not store data after
        a VPS has been terminated. All data from terminated VPS instances is permanently and forensically deleted.</p>
    <p>By using our Service, users agree to abide by all applicable <strong>United States laws</strong>. Any illegal
        activities or excessive data ingress/egress may result in immediate termination without notice.</p>

    <h2>4. Splunk Ingestion, Indexing, and Storage Fair Use</h2>
    <p>Backyard Bandwidth provides Splunk ingestion, indexing, and storage services subject to the following fair use
        guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users are allowed to ingest and index data up to the allocated limit specified in their service plan.
            Exceeding this limit without prior authorization may result in access restrictions, suspension, or
            termination without notice.
        </li>
        <li>Attempts to bypass or manipulate data ingestion limits, including but not limited to data obfuscation or
            compression methods designed to evade fair use policies, are strictly prohibited.
        </li>
        <li>If a user is found to be ingesting or indexing more data than their allowed limit, they may be terminated
            without notice and are <strong>not eligible for refunds</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>Backyard Bandwidth reserves the right to monitor ingestion volumes to ensure compliance with fair use
            thresholds and maintain network stability.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. S3 Storage Fair Use</h2>
    <p>Backyard Bandwidth offers S3-compatible storage with free ingress (data uploads) and free egress (data
        downloads), subject to the following conditions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users may egress (download) data without charge up to the amount of data they have stored.</li>
        <li>If a user egresses more data than they have stored, additional fees or restrictions may apply.</li>
        <li>Backyard Bandwidth reserves the right to limit or suspend access for users who exceed fair use thresholds in
            a manner that negatively impacts network stability.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Bruteforce Attempts and Security Violations</h2>
    <p>Backyard Bandwidth maintains a strict policy against bruteforce attempts on any of its services, including VPN,
        VPS, Splunk, and storage services. If a user is found to be attempting or engaging in bruteforce activities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Their account will be <strong>terminated immediately without notice</strong>.</li>
        <li>No refunds will be issued for terminated accounts involved in bruteforce attempts.</li>
        <li>Backyard Bandwidth reserves the right to report such activities to relevant authorities as required by
            law.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Termination for Violations</h2>
    <p>Users found to be in violation of this Policy, including but not limited to excessive egress/ingress, illegal
        activities, data ingestion manipulation, bruteforce attempts, or abuse of the Service, may have their access
        restricted, suspended, or permanently terminated without prior notice.</p>
    <p>Additionally, as outlined in our <a href="http://backyardbandwidth.com/policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, we
        reserve the right to terminate accounts without notice if a user is found to be engaging in activities that
        violate <strong>United States law</strong> while using our Service.</p>

    <h2>8. No Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>All services terminated due to a violation of this Policy are <strong>not eligible for refunds</strong>. Users
        accept that no reimbursement will be provided for terminated services.</p>

    <h2>9. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound
        by this Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, you must immediately stop using the Service.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States. Any disputes
        arising from or relating to this Policy shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state
        courts located in the state of Virginia.</p>

    <h2>11. Severability</h2>
    <p>If any provision of this Policy is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue
        to be fully valid, binding, and enforceable.</p>

    <h2>12. Network Bandwidth Fair Use</h2>
    <p>All Backyard Bandwidth services that utilize network infrastructure—including VPN, VPS, S3-compatible storage,
        Splunk ingestion, or any other networked service—are subject to fair use limits on network bandwidth
        consumption.</p>

    <p>Normal usage patterns and occasional high-traffic spikes are acceptable, including large software updates,
        backups, or short-term data transfers. However, long-term sustained high bandwidth consumption that degrades
        network performance for others is a violation of this Fair Use Policy.</p>

    <h3>VPS Bandwidth Limits (Per Instance)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tiny (1 GB RAM / 1 CPU / 20 GB disk):</strong> Up to <strong>10 GB/day egress</strong> and <strong>200
            GB/month total network traffic</strong>. Usage beyond these limits may incur additional charges or bandwidth
            restrictions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Small (4 GB RAM / 4 CPU / 100 GB disk):</strong> 75 GB/day egress, 500 GB/week total</li>
        <li><strong>Medium (16 GB RAM / 8 CPU / 200 GB disk):</strong> 150 GB/day egress, 1.2 TB/week total</li>
        <li><strong>Large (32 GB RAM / 16 CPU / 400 GB disk):</strong> 300 GB/day egress, 2.5 TB/week total</li>
        <li><strong>Huge (64 GB RAM / 32 CPU / 1 TB disk):</strong> 600 GB/day egress, 5 TB/week total</li>
        <li><strong>Massive (128 GB RAM / 40 CPU / 2 TB disk):</strong> 1 TB/day egress, 10 TB/week total</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Note:</em> Users requiring higher sustained throughput or monthly transfer volumes are encouraged to contact
        support for a custom bandwidth allocation or overage pricing options.</p>

    <p>Accidental or short-term overages will not result in enforcement action. However, repeated or continuous misuse
        may result in rate limiting, suspension, or termination <strong>without refund</strong>.</p>

    <p>Users will typically receive one or more warnings before enforcement, unless network integrity is at risk. Custom
        plans are available for users with consistently high bandwidth needs—please contact support for
        arrangements.</p>


    <h2>13. Updates to this Policy</h2>
    <p>Backyard Bandwidth reserves the right to update or modify this Policy at any time to ensure the continued
        integrity and performance of our network. Continued use of the Service after any modifications constitutes
        acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
