    <h1>Fair Use Policy</h1>

    <p>Last Updated: Monday, February 3rd, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Fair Use Policy ("Policy") sets forth the acceptable use guidelines for Backyard Bandwidth's VPN, VPS, and storage services ("Service"). While we do not impose arbitrary limits on bandwidth, speed, or usage, we maintain this policy to ensure fair and reasonable access for all users. By using our Service, you agree to comply with this Policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Unlimited Use Under Fair Use</h2>
    <p>Backyard Bandwidth provides VPN services without data caps or speed restrictions. However, this offering is contingent upon fair and reasonable use. Excessive or abnormal usage that negatively impacts network performance, degrades service quality for other users, or places an undue burden on our infrastructure may result in action under this Policy.</p>

    <p>Backyard Bandwidth does <strong>not log, track, or monitor user activity</strong> on our VPN services. Users are not subject to logging or tracking under our <a href="http://backyardbandwidth.com/policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. We do not retain records of browsing history, connection times, metadata, IP addresses, or other identifying information related to VPN use.</p>

    <h2>3. VPS Privacy and Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Backyard Bandwidth does not log, monitor, or track user activity on our VPS services. We do not store data after a VPS has been terminated. All data from terminated VPS instances is permanently and forensically deleted.</p>
    <p>By using our Service, users agree to abide by all applicable <strong>United States laws</strong>. Any illegal activities or excessive data ingress/egress may result in immediate termination without notice.</p>

    <h2>4. S3 Storage Fair Use</h2>
    <p>Backyard Bandwidth offers S3-compatible storage with free ingress (data uploads) and free egress (data downloads), subject to the following conditions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users may egress (download) data without charge up to the amount of data they have stored.</li>
        <li>If a user egresses more data than they have stored, additional fees or restrictions may apply.</li>
        <li>Backyard Bandwidth reserves the right to limit or suspend access for users who exceed fair use thresholds in a manner that negatively impacts network stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Termination for Violations</h2>
    <p>Users found to be in violation of this Policy, including but not limited to excessive egress/ingress, illegal activities, or abuse of the Service, may have their access restricted, suspended, or permanently terminated without prior notice.</p>
    <p>Additionally, as outlined in our <a href="http://backyardbandwidth.com/policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, we reserve the right to terminate accounts without notice if a user is found to be engaging in activities that violate <strong>United States law</strong> while using our Service.</p>

    <h2>6. No Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>All services terminated due to a violation of this Policy are <strong>not eligible for refunds</strong>. Users accept that no reimbursement will be provided for terminated services.</p>

    <h2>7. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by this Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, you must immediately stop using the Service.</p>

    <h2>8. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States. Any disputes arising from or relating to this Policy shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the state of Virginia.</p>

    <h2>9. Severability</h2>
    <p>If any provision of this Policy is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue to be fully valid, binding, and enforceable.</p>

    <h2>10. Updates to this Policy</h2>
    <p>Backyard Bandwidth reserves the right to update or modify this Policy at any time to ensure the continued integrity and performance of our network. Continued use of the Service after any modifications constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
