    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
    <p>Last updated: Sunday, April 20th, 2025<br><br>

        This Privacy Policy governs your use of this website and all services provided through it. By accessing
        or using this website, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy, the <a href="fair-use.html">Fair
            Use Policy</a>, and any applicable laws
        and regulations of the United States. If you do not agree with these terms, you must discontinue using
        this website immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>
        We collect only the minimum amount of data necessary to provide and improve our services. By using our
        website, you consent to the collection and processing of such data, as outlined below:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Half of your email address for account verification and customer service purposes.</li>
        <li>Your IP address is temporarily stored for up to 24 hours for security and anti-abuse measures.</li>
        <li>We do not store or retain any browsing history, traffic data, or connection metadata.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>VPS Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        Backyard Bandwidth does <strong>not log, track, or monitor user activity</strong> on our VPS services.
        Users are not subject to tracking under our Privacy Policy.
        <strong>Once a VPS has been terminated, all data associated with the VPS is permanently and forensically
            deleted.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        While using our VPS service, we do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties, except as required by
        law or necessary to provide our services.
    </p>
    <p>
        To ensure compliance with our <a href="fair-use.html">Fair Use Policy</a>, we collect and retain basic network
        usage statistics, including total ingress and egress volumes per VPS instance. These usage graphs are used
        solely
        to monitor bandwidth consumption and detect policy violations. They do not include logs of user activity or
        content, and are not shared externally. <strong>Once a VPS is deleted or removed, the associated usage graph is
        also
        permanently deleted from our systems.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>VPN Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        Backyard Bandwidth does <strong>not log, track, or store</strong> any data related to VPN usage. Specifically,
        we do not:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Log users' traffic or the content of any communications.</li>
        <li>Log which websites you visit.</li>
        <li>Store your original or assigned IP address.</li>
        <li>Log session durations or timestamps.</li>
        <li>Track or collect location-based data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Additionally, all VPN data is <strong>never stored or retained in any form</strong>.
        All VPN traffic is encrypted, ensuring your online activity remains private and secure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some IP addresses assigned to our VPN services may be leased from third-party providers, and Backyard Bandwidth
        may not have direct ownership of these addresses. However, we do <strong>not log any data on these providers'
        IPs</strong> and use a <strong>modified version of our VPN server</strong> to enforce our strict no-logging
        policy across all assigned IP addresses.
    </p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
        We strive to maintain a secure and reliable platform. However, we do not guarantee the uninterrupted
        availability or complete security of our services. Users are responsible for ensuring their own compliance
        with applicable laws and for the proper use of our platform.
    </p>
